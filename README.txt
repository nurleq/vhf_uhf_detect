`SignalProcessor` class captures an RF signal from the SDR and applies a Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) to extract frequency components. The `VHF_UHF_Detector` class uses the `SignalProcessor` class
to detect VHF and UHF signals by comparing the extracted frequencies with known signal patterns.

Note that this is a simplified example and may not work for all cases. You may need to modify or extend this
code to suit your specific requirements, such as:

* Using different SDR libraries like RTL-SDR or HackRF
* Applying more advanced signal processing algorithms, such as correlation analysis or peak detection
* Incorporating database lookup or machine learning techniques to improve signal detection accuracy

Also, please note that detecting and monitoring RF signals can be a complex task, requiring knowledge of RF
engineering, signal processing, and possibly regulatory compliance with relevant frequency allocation standards.
